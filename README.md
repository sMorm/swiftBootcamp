These are fun algorithms from Brian Vong's teachings at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuP2vJ6kRutQBfRmdcI92mA. I will be using Swift to learn these Algorithms along with practicing the Swift/Objective-C syntax. Also, I will include comments so that other users can follow along and learn the language as well as the algorithms.
